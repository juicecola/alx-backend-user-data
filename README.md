Backend user data typically includes user account information, such as usernames, passwords (usually encrypted or hashed for security), email addresses, user preferences, access permissions, and any other relevant data required for user authentication, authorization, and personalization within a web application or system. This data is stored and managed on the server-side and is essential for providing personalized and secure user experiences.
